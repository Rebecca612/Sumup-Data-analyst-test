Part 1 – KPI Definitions
This section outlines the core KPIs used to evaluate the performance and health of the POS Lite acquisition funnels.

1. Lead Acquisition Cost
Lead Acquisition Cost measures the total marketing spend required to acquire a lead or customer, segmented by acquisition path (Self-Service vs Sales-Assisted).
This KPI provides a clear view of acquisition efficiency and enables comparison across channels, countries, and funnel types. It serves as a baseline metric for assessing how effectively marketing investment is converted into demand and closed business.

2. Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)
Return on Ad Spend measures the value generated from marketing spend relative to the investment made.
In the context of POS Lite, this KPI evaluates whether marketing activities are generating sufficient business outcomes, such as closed POS Lite deals or estimated revenue. It shifts the focus from cost minimisation to value creation and supports data-driven budget allocation decisions.

3. Funnel Conversion Rates
Funnel Conversion Rates measure the percentage of users or leads who progress from one funnel stage to the next.
Tracking conversion rates across both the Self-Service and Sales-Assisted funnels helps identify where friction occurs in the customer journey and isolates performance issues at specific funnel stages, whether driven by marketing effectiveness, product experience, or sales execution.

4. Lead Quality per Channel
Lead Quality per Channel evaluates not only the volume of leads generated but also their likelihood to convert into qualified opportunities and POS Lite deals.
While some channels may generate high lead volumes, not all leads require the same sales effort or exhibit the same conversion potential. This KPI assesses channel performance using both volume and downstream conversion metrics, enabling a four-quadrant analysis to distinguish scalable, high-quality channels from those generating low-intent demand.

5. POS Lite Acquisition Volume
POS Lite Acquisition Volume measures the total number of POS Lite deals acquired across both self-service and sales-assisted funnels.
This KPI ensures that efficiency optimisations are evaluated alongside absolute growth, providing visibility into overall business impact and market penetration.
