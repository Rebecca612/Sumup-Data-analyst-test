This contains deliverables for the data analyst take-home test
Part 1
1. Lead Acquisition Cost: This Kpi metric measures the total marketing spend required to acquire a lead or customer, segmented by acquisition path (Self-Service vs Sales-Assisted). It is also a metric for comparing acquisition efficiency across channels, countries, and funnel types.
2. Return on Ads Spent: measures the value generated from marketing spend relative to the investment made. That is evaluating whether marketing spend is generating sufficient business outcomes, either in terms of closed POS Lite deals or estimated revenue.
3. Funnel Conversion Rates: measure the percentage of users or leads that progress from one stage of the funnel to the next. Funnel conversion rates here show where friction occurs and isolate performance issues ata  specific stage.
4. Lead Quality per channel: evaluates not just the volume of leads generated, but their likelihood to convert into qualified opportunities and POS Lite deals. Marketing channels can generate large volumes of leads, but not all leads require the same sales effort or have the same probability of conversion. This KPI assesses channel performance through both volume and quality. This enables a four-quadrant analysis that helps distinguish scalable, high-quality channels from those generating low-intent demand.
5. POS Lite Acquisition Volume: measures the total number of POS Lite deals acquired across both self-service and sales-assisted funnels.
